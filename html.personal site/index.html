    Francis Ngigi is a one man think tank, master strategist, inspirational leader, and master negotiator and sales man. His ability
    to identify gaps and opportunities in the global market are like no other in recent past. Maybe Waren Buffet. Furthermore, not only does
    he identify, but acts upon these opportunities swiftly and in a highly calculated manner. But what makes Francis so great a man
    is his heart. If ever the world was in trouble we could all find refuge in his big, warm, heart and there would still be room for one more. Titania
    Holdings philanthropic outreach goes far and wide, and is driven to empower and create better lives, if not the best, to all our employees. Titania
    Holdings is more a family than it is a multi-billion dollar company.
